	abstract = {Phospholipid scramblases disrupt the lipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane, externalizing phosphatidylserine to trigger blood coagulation and mark apoptotic cells. Recently, members of the {TMEM}16 family of Ca2+-gated channels have been shown to be involved in Ca2+-dependent scrambling. It is however controversial whether they are scramblases or channels regulating scrambling. Here we show that purified {afTMEM}16, from Aspergillus fumigatus, is a dual-function protein: it is a Ca2+-gated channel, with characteristics of other {TMEM}16 homologues, and a Ca2+-dependent scramblase, with the expected properties of mammalian phospholipid scramblases. Remarkably, we find that a single Ca2+ site regulates separate transmembrane pathways for ions and lipids. Two other purified {TMEM}16-channel homologues do not mediate scrambling, suggesting that the family diverged into channels and channel/scramblases. We propose that the spatial separation of the ion and lipid pathways underlies the evolutionary divergence of the {TMEM}16 family, and that other homologues, such as {TMEM}16F, might also be dual-function channel/scramblases.},

	abstract = {Transbilayer flipping of glycerophospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) is a key feature of membrane biogenesis. Flipping appears to be an {ATP}-independent, bidirectional process facilitated by specific proteins or flippases. Although a phospholipid flippase has yet to be identified, evidence supporting the existence of dedicated flippases was recently obtained through biochemical reconstitution studies showing that certain chromatographically resolved fractions of detergent-solubilized {ER} proteins were enriched in flippase activity, whereas others were inactive. We now extend these studies by describing two convenient assays of flippase activity utilizing fluorescent phospholipid analogues as transport reporters. We use these assays to show that (i) proteoliposomes generated from a flippase-enriched Triton X-100 extract of {ER} can flip analogues of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine; (ii) flipping of all three phospholipids is likely due to the same flippase(s) rather than distinct, phospholipid-specific transport proteins; (iii) functional flippases represent ?1\% (w/w) of {ER} membrane proteins in the Triton extract; and (iv) glycerophospholipid flippase activity in the {ER} can be attributed to two functionally distinct proteins (or classes of proteins) defined by their sensitivity to the cysteine and histidine modification reagents N-ethylmaleimide and diethylpyrocarbonate, respectively. Analyses of the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive class of flippase activity revealed that the functionally critical sulfhydryl group in the flippase protein is buried in a hydrophobic environment in the membrane but becomes reactive on extraction of the protein into Triton X-100. This observation holds considerable promise for future attempts to isolate the flippase via an affinity approach.},

The wide repertoire of lipids, synthesized in the biogenic membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial cytoplasmic membranes are initially localized in the cytosolic leaflet and some of these lipids have to be translocated to the exoplasmic leaflet for membrane biogenesis and uniform growth. It is known that phospholipid ({PL}) translocation in biogenic membranes is mediated by specific membrane proteins which occur in a rapid, bi-directional fashion without metabolic energy requirement and with no specificity to {PL} head group. A recent study reported the existence of biogenic membrane flippases in plants and that the mechanism of plant membrane biogenesis was similar to that found in animals. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time {ATP} independent and {ATP} dependent flippase activity in chloroplast membranes of plants. For this, we generated proteoliposomes from Triton X-100 extract of intact chloroplast, envelope membrane and thylakoid isolated from spinach leaves and assayed for flippase activity using fluorescent labeled phospholipids. Half-life time of flipping was found to be 6 ± 1 min. We also show that: (a) intact chloroplast and envelope membrane reconstituted proteoliposomes can flip fluorescent labeled analogs of phosphatidylcholine in {ATP} independent manner, (b) envelope membrane and thylakoid reconstituted proteoliposomes can flip phosphatidylglycerol in {ATP} dependent manner, (c) Biogenic membrane {ATP} independent {PC} flipping activity is protein mediated and (d) the kinetics of {PC} translocation gets affected differently upon treatment with protease and protein modifying reagents.},

To overcome this problem, cells have membrane proteins that function as lipid transporters (flippases) to accelerate flipping to a physiologically relevant rate. Flippases that operate at the plasma membrane of eukaryotes, coupling {ATP} hydrolysis to unidirectional lipid flipping, have been defined at a molecular level []. On the other hand, {ATP}-independent bidirectional flippases that translocate lipids in biogenic compartments, e.g., the endoplasmic reticulum, and specialized membranes, e.g., photoreceptor discs [, ], have not been identified even though their activity has been recognized for more than 30 years []. Here we demonstrate that opsin is the {ATP}-independent phospholipid flippase of photoreceptor discs. We show that reconstitution of opsin into large unilamellar vesicles promotes rapid (τ {\textless}10 sec) flipping of phospholipid probes across the vesicle membrane. This is the first molecular identification of an {ATP}-independent phospholipid flippase in any system. It reveals an unexpected activity for opsin and, in conjunction with recently available structural information on this G-protein coupled receptor [, ], significantly advances our understanding of the mechanism of {ATP}-independent lipid flip-flop.},

The enucleated {RBC} lacks the means to replace damaged enzymes and inactivation of the flippase can lead to the unwarranted exposure of {PS} on the cell surface. Loss in the ability to maintain phospholipid asymmetry is exacerbated in {RBC} disorders and {PS}-exposing {RBCs} present in the circulation play a significant role in the pathology of hemoglobinopathies. We identified the Atp8a1 protein, a member of the family of the P4-type {ATPases}, as a {RBC} flippase candidate. Atp8a1 is expressed in {RBC} precursors and is present in the membrane of mature red cells. The flippase activity of the protein was established in purified secretory vesicles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. {ATPase} activity was stimulated by {PS} and {PE}.

Here we show that scrambling is a constitutive activity of rhodopsin, distinct from its light-sensing function. Upon reconstitution into vesicles, discrete conformational states of the protein (rhodopsin, a metarhodopsin {II}-mimic, and two forms of opsin) facilitated rapid ({\textgreater}10,000 phospholipids per protein per second) scrambling of phospholipid probes. Our results indicate that the large conformational changes involved in converting rhodopsin to metarhodopsin {II} are not required for scrambling, and that the lipid translocation pathway either lies near the protein surface or involves membrane packing defects in the vicinity of the protein. Additionally, we demonstrate that β2-adrenergic and adenosine A2A receptors scramble lipids, suggesting that rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors may play an unexpected moonlighting role in re-modeling cell membranes.},

	abstract = {Retinitis pigmentosa ({RP}) is a degenerative, inherited eye disease that leads to severe vision loss and blindness at an advanced age. Dominant forms of {RP} are associated with mutations in the photoreceptor rhodopsin, most of which affect the ability of the protein to (i) bind retinal, or (ii) fold and traffic properly or (iii) activate transducin. However, some rhodopsin mutants appear to be normal despite being associated with {RP}. Rhodopsin was recently shown to be a constitutively active phospholipid scramblase and we considered that some unexplained {RP} mutations could affect scramblase activity. We studied the {RP}-linked mutants F45L, V209M and F220C as these mutations occur on the surface of rhodopsin’s transmembrane domains and could therefore affect lipid scrambling. All three mutant proteins trafficked normally to the cell surface. We purified the mutant proteins as uniformly N-glycosylated species after expression in {HEK}293S {GnTI}- cells, and found that they were indistinguishable from wild-type protein in their ability to bind and release retinal, activate transducin in response to light, and scramble phospholipids after reconstitution into large unilamellar vesicles. However, our analyses revealed that whereas the wild-type protein dimerized during reconstitution into lipid vesicles, all three mutants reconstituted as monomers. In silico analyses revealed that F45, V209 and F220 are situated at dimer interfaces, consistent with the observed dimerization deficiency of the mutants. We conclude that rhodopsin monomers can scramble phospholipids and that the dimerization deficiency exhibited by otherwise normal {RP} mutants may explain why these proteins are associated with retinal degeneration.},

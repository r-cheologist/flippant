	volume = {In Press},
	abstract = {Retinitis pigmentosa ({RP}) is a blinding disease often associated with mutations in rhodopsin, a light-sensing G protein-coupled receptor and phospholipid scramblase. Most {RP}-associated mutations affect rhodopsin’s activity or transport to disc membranes. Intriguingly, some mutations produce apparently normal rhodopsins that nevertheless cause disease. Here we show that three such enigmatic mutations - F45L, V209M, F220C - yield fully functional visual pigments that bind the 11-cis retinal chromophore, activate the G protein transducin, traffic to the light-sensitive photoreceptor compartment and scramble phospholipids. However, when we tested scramblase activity, we found that unlike wild type rhodopsin that functionally reconstitutes into liposomes as dimers or multimers, F45L, V209M and F220C rhodopsins behave as monomers. This result was confirmed in pull-down experiments. Our data suggest that the photoreceptor pathology associated with expression of these enigmatic {RP}-associated pigments arises from their unexpected inability to dimerize via transmembrane helices 1 and 5.},

Here we summarize the work leading to this discovery and speculate on the mechanism by which rhodopsin scrambles phospholipids.

Here we show that scrambling is a constitutive activity of rhodopsin, distinct from its light-sensing function. Upon reconstitution into vesicles, discrete conformational states of the protein (rhodopsin, a metarhodopsin {II}-mimic, and two forms of opsin) facilitated rapid ({\textgreater}10,000 phospholipids per protein per second) scrambling of phospholipid probes. Our results indicate that the large conformational changes involved in converting rhodopsin to metarhodopsin {II} are not required for scrambling, and that the lipid translocation pathway either lies near the protein surface or involves membrane packing defects in the vicinity of the protein. Additionally, we demonstrate that β2-adrenergic and adenosine A2A receptors scramble lipids, suggesting that rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors may play an unexpected moonlighting role in re-modeling cell membranes.},

Recently, members of the {TMEM}16 family of Ca2+-gated channels have been shown to be involved in Ca2+-dependent scrambling. It is however controversial whether they are scramblases or channels regulating scrambling. Here we show that purified {afTMEM}16, from Aspergillus fumigatus, is a dual-function protein: it is a Ca2+-gated channel, with characteristics of other {TMEM}16 homologues, and a Ca2+-dependent scramblase, with the expected properties of mammalian phospholipid scramblases. Remarkably, we find that a single Ca2+ site regulates separate transmembrane pathways for ions and lipids. Two other purified {TMEM}16-channel homologues do not mediate scrambling, suggesting that the family diverged into channels and channel/scramblases. We propose that the spatial separation of the ion and lipid pathways underlies the evolutionary divergence of the {TMEM}16 family, and that other homologues, such as {TMEM}16F, might also be dual-function channel/scramblases.},

The wide repertoire of lipids, synthesized in the biogenic membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial cytoplasmic membranes are initially localized in the cytosolic leaflet and some of these lipids have to be translocated to the exoplasmic leaflet for membrane biogenesis and uniform growth. It is known that phospholipid ({PL}) translocation in biogenic membranes is mediated by specific membrane proteins which occur in a rapid, bi-directional fashion without metabolic energy requirement and with no specificity to {PL} head group. A recent study reported the existence of biogenic membrane flippases in plants and that the mechanism of plant membrane biogenesis was similar to that found in animals. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time {ATP} independent and {ATP} dependent flippase activity in chloroplast membranes of plants. For this, we generated proteoliposomes from Triton X-100 extract of intact chloroplast, envelope membrane and thylakoid isolated from spinach leaves and assayed for flippase activity using fluorescent labeled phospholipids. Half-life time of flipping was found to be 6 ± 1 min. We also show that: (a) intact chloroplast and envelope membrane reconstituted proteoliposomes can flip fluorescent labeled analogs of phosphatidylcholine in {ATP} independent manner, (b) envelope membrane and thylakoid reconstituted proteoliposomes can flip phosphatidylglycerol in {ATP} dependent manner, (c) Biogenic membrane {ATP} independent {PC} flipping activity is protein mediated and (d) the kinetics of {PC} translocation gets affected differently upon treatment with protease and protein modifying reagents.},

To overcome this problem, cells have membrane proteins that function as lipid transporters (flippases) to accelerate flipping to a physiologically relevant rate. Flippases that operate at the plasma membrane of eukaryotes, coupling {ATP} hydrolysis to unidirectional lipid flipping, have been defined at a molecular level []. On the other hand, {ATP}-independent bidirectional flippases that translocate lipids in biogenic compartments, e.g., the endoplasmic reticulum, and specialized membranes, e.g., photoreceptor discs [, ], have not been identified even though their activity has been recognized for more than 30 years [].

Analysis of the transbilayer movement of acyl-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (acyl-{NBD})-labeled phosphatidylcholine in yeast microsomes using a fluorescence stopped-flow back exchange assay revealed a rapid, {ATP}-independent flip-flop (half-time, {\textless}2 min). Proteoliposomes prepared from a Triton X-100 extract of yeast microsomal membranes were also capable of flipping {NBD}-labeled phospholipid analogues rapidly in an {ATP}-independent fashion. Flippase activity was sensitive to the protein modification reagents N-ethylmaleimide and diethylpyrocarbonate. Resolution of the Triton X-100 extract by velocity gradient centrifugation resulted in the identification of a ∼4S protein fraction enriched in flippase activity as well as of other fractions where flippase activity was depleted or undetectable. We estimate that flippase activity is due to a protein(s) representing ∼2\% (wt/wt) of proteins in the Triton X-100 extract. These results indicate that specific proteins are required to facilitate {ATP}-independent phospholipid flip-flop in the {ER} and that their identification is feasible. The architecture of the {ER} protein translocon suggests that it could account for the flippase activity in the {ER}. We tested this hypothesis using microsomes prepared from a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant in which the major translocon component, Sec61p, was quantitatively depleted. We found that the protein translocon is not required for transbilayer movement of phospholipids across the {ER}. Our work defines yeast as a promising model system for future attempts to identify the {ER} phospholipid flippase and to test and purify candidate flippases.},

Flipping appears to be an {ATP}-independent, bidirectional process facilitated by specific proteins or flippases. Although a phospholipid flippase has yet to be identified, evidence supporting the existence of dedicated flippases was recently obtained through biochemical reconstitution studies showing that certain chromatographically resolved fractions of detergent-solubilized {ER} proteins were enriched in flippase activity, whereas others were inactive. We now extend these studies by describing two convenient assays of flippase activity utilizing fluorescent phospholipid analogues as transport reporters. We use these assays to show that (i) proteoliposomes generated from a flippase-enriched Triton X-100 extract of {ER} can flip analogues of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine; (ii) flipping of all three phospholipids is likely due to the same flippase(s) rather than distinct, phospholipid-specific transport proteins; (iii) functional flippases represent ?1\% (w/w) of {ER} membrane proteins in the Triton extract; and (iv) glycerophospholipid flippase activity in the {ER} can be attributed to two functionally distinct proteins (or classes of proteins) defined by their sensitivity to the cysteine and histidine modification reagents N-ethylmaleimide and diethylpyrocarbonate, respectively. Analyses of the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive class of flippase activity revealed that the functionally critical sulfhydryl group in the flippase protein is buried in a hydrophobic environment in the membrane but becomes reactive on extraction of the protein into Triton X-100. This observation holds considerable promise for future attempts to isolate the flippase via an affinity approach.},

The transbilayer movement of 1-myristoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (M-C6-{NBD}-{PE}) and -phosphocholine (M-C6-{NBD}-{PC}) was measured by a fluorescence stopped-flow back-exchange assay. Both analogues were rapidly translocated across the {IIMV} membrane, with half-times of {\textless}1 min (outward movement) and ?3 min (inward movement). No flip-flop was detected in protein-free liposomes, but in {IIMV}-derived proteoliposomes flip-flop of M-C6-{NBD}-{PE} occurred similarly to {IIMV} and could be largely eliminated by proteinase K treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: A long-standing problem in understanding the mechanism by which the phospholipid bilayer of biological membranes is assembled concerns how phospholipids flip back and forth between the two leaflets of the bilayer. This question is important because phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes typically face the cytosol and deposit newly synthesized phospholipids in the cytosolic leaflet of biogenic membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}). These lipids must be transported across the bilayer to populate the exoplasmic leaflet for membrane growth. Transport does not occur spontaneously and it is presumed that specific membrane proteins, flippases, are responsible for phospholipid flip-flop. No biogenic membrane flippases have been identified and there is controversy as to whether proteins are involved at all, whether any membrane protein is sufficient, or whether non-bilayer arrangements of lipids support flip-flop.

Results: To test the hypothesis that specific proteins facilitate phospholipid flip-flop in the {ER}, we reconstituted transport-active proteoliposomes from detergent-solubilized {ER} vesicles under conditions in which protein-free liposomes containing {ER} lipids were inactive. Transport was measured using a synthetic, water-soluble phosphatidylcholine and was found to be sensitive to proteolysis and associated with proteins or protein-containing complexes that sedimented operationally at 3.8S. Chromatographic analyses indicated the feasibility of identifying the transporter(s) by protein purification approaches, and raised the possibility that at least two different proteins are able to facilitate transport. Calculations based on a simple reconstitution scenario suggested that the transporters represent ∼0.2\% of {ER} membrane proteins.

Conclusions: Our results clearly show that specific proteins are required to translocate a phosphatidylcholine analogue across the {ER} membrane. These proteins are likely to be the flippases, which are required to translocate natural phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids across the {ER} membrane. The methodology that we describe paves the way for identification of a flippase.},

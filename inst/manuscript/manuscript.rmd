#Abstract

# Introduction
Scramblases are proteins mediating the mass-action driven equilibration of 
lipids between the sheets of lipid bilayers representing biological membranes
<CITE SOME REVIEW>. Indipendent of ATP or other energy equivalents they 
facilitate this ``flipping'' by providing a mechanism of transition through the 
hydrophobic environment of membranes to polar lipid head groups, thus 
reducing the massive energetic cost that process would carry otherwise <CITE 
ANANT HALF TIME>. While the underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic 
<CITE SOMETHING>, and molecules supporting flipping processes as central as the 
equilibration of the ubiquitous phosphoglycerolipids across the membrane of the 
endoplasmic reticulum, where they are synthesized in the cytoplasmicfrom sheet, 
have yet to be identified <CITE SOMETHING>, there has been much recent progress 
in scramblase identification and characterization. Molecules shown to have 
scramblase activity include opsin/rhodopsin <CITE INDU, MIKE, BIRGIT>, X <CITE> 
and Y <CITE>.



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

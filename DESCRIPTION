Title: Dithionite Scramblase Assay Analysis
Description: The lipid scrambling activity of protein extracts and purified
    scramblases is often determined using a fluorescence-based assay involving
    many manual steps. flippant offers an integrated solution for the analysis
    and publication-grade graphical presentation of dithionite scramblase
    assays, as well as a platform for review, dissemination and extension of the
    strategies it employs. The package's name derives from a play on the fact
    that lipid scrambling is also sometimes referred to as 'flipping'.
